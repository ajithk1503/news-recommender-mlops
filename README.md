## Features  
- Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization)  
- Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF over news articles)  
- Feedback Loop for real-time adaptation  
- MLOps pipeline including:
  - Model training and evaluation
### Need to be developed
  - Include neural network as a recommender
  - Build online learner to improve feedback loop
  - API deployment via FastAPI  
  - Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana  
  - Workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow  
  - Online learning integration
